The purpose of this project is to convert text in the pdf to utf8 text.
Prerequisites to contributing to this project are as follows:
    - Knowledge of Git protocols
    - knowlegde of Devanagari script and the ability to type in a machine

I personally use https://www.google.com/intl/sa/inputtools/try/ but to each his own. Translations are also welcome. We don't just need manual text extraction but also reviews so that the text is correctly written down. You may raise requests for participation and also raise issues.
