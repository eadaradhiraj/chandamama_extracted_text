Chandamama
Founder: Chakrapani
Director: Nagireddy

"Chandamama" I will henceforth be published every month in Sanskrit. There are 2 aspects in every language - easy and difficult. Here the stories will be in simple sanskrit. I am of the view that Students should read with enthusiasm, and know the meaning. Therefore, only wel-known words are used here. Sandhi, long compounds, long syntaxes, etc are not used. And the word bhavAn(respectful 'you') is used in place of yuSmad(you).

My name "Chandamama" is popular and widely-known everywhere in India.Please hear the meaning of my name in Sanskrit - the Ma of canda is candamA. candamAM mAti = candamAmA. canda is candra (moon). mA is zrI (lakshmi). mAti = measure. It means to be like the moonlight.
